Alcoholism and drug abuse is a very controversial topic, and a serious issue within the EU. As the Internet grows, inherently, people have more access to these substances. This can lead to serious complications, such as health issues, and sometimes even cases of overdose can occur. However, countries are tackling this by implementing various measures, and rehabilitation is more available now, than it ever has been in history. This is an overall interesting topic to analyze, and the main questions we will try to answer through this research will be:

- What are the trends of drug and alcohol abuse like in Europe through the years?
- How effective are governments in tackling these problems?
- The deaths caused by overdosing through the years?
- Does the price of these substances affect amount of abuse?
- Does the purity of the substances reduce death caused by them?
